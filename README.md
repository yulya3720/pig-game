GAME RULES:
- the game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- in each turn, player rolls dice as many time as they wish. Each result is added to their ROUND score
- but if the player rols a 1, their entire ROUND score gets lost and after that it`s next player`s turn
- the player can choose to 'hold', which means that their round score gets added to their GLOBAL score and after that it`s next player`s turn
- the first player to reach the winning score on GLOBAL score wins the game
- a player looses their ENTIRE score when they roll two 6`s
- winning score is automatically set to 100, but can be changed in the input field
